        Sometimes a toolkit class that's designed for reuse isn't reusable
        only because its interface doesn't match the domain-specific interface
        an application requires.
    </p>

    <a name="auto1003"></a>
    <p>
        Consider for example a drawing editor that lets users draw and arrange
        graphical elements (lines, polygons, text, etc.) into pictures and
        diagrams.  The drawing editor's key abstraction is the graphical
        object, which has an editable shape and can draw itself.  The
        interface for graphical objects is defined by an abstract class called
        Shape.  The editor defines a subclass of Shape for each kind of
        graphical object: a LineShape class for lines, a PolygonShape class
        for polygons, and so forth.
    </p>

    <a name="textshape"></a>
    <a name="textview"></a>
    <p>
        Classes for elementary geometric shapes like LineShape and
        PolygonShape are rather easy to implement, because their drawing and
        editing capabilities are inherently limited.  But a TextShape subclass
        that can display and edit text is considerably more difficult to
        implement, since even basic text editing involves complicated screen
        update and buffer management.  Meanwhile, an off-the-shelf user
        interface toolkit might already provide a sophisticated TextView class
        for displaying and editing text.  Ideally we'd like to reuse TextView
        to implement TextShape, but the toolkit wasn't designed with Shape
        classes in mind.  So we can't use TextView and Shape objects
        interchangeably.
    </p>

    <a name="auto1004"></a>
    <p>
        How can existing and unrelated classes like TextView work in an
        application that expects classes with a different and incompatible
        interface?  We could change the TextView class so that it conforms to
        the Shape interface, but that isn't an option unless we have the
        toolkit's source code.  Even if we did, it wouldn't make sense to
        change TextView; the toolkit shouldn't have to adopt domain-specific
        interfaces just to make one application work.
    </p>

    <a name="adapterdef"></a>
    <p>
        Instead, we could define TextShape so that it <em>adapts</em> the
        TextView interface to Shape's.  We can do this in one of two ways: (1)
        by inheriting Shape's interface and TextView's implementation or (2)
        by composing a TextView instance within a TextShape and implementing
        TextShape in terms of TextView's interface.  These two approaches
        correspond to the class and object versions of the Adapter pattern.
        We call TextShape an <strong>adapter</strong>.
    </p>

    <a name="auto1005"></a>
    <p>
        This diagram illustrates the object adapter case. It shows how
        BoundingBox requests, declared in class Shape, are converted to
        GetExtent requests defined in TextView.  Since TextShape adapts
        TextView to the Shape interface, the drawing editor can reuse the
        otherwise incompatible TextView class.
    </p>

    <a name="auto1006"></a>
    <p>
        Often the adapter is responsible for functionality the adapted class
        doesn't provide.  The diagram shows how an adapter can fulfill
        such responsibilities.  The user should be able to "drag" every
        Shape object to a new location interactively, but TextView isn't
        designed to do that.  TextShape can add this missing functionality by
        implementing Shape's CreateManipulator operation, which returns an
        instance of the appropriate Manipulator subclass.
    </p>

    <a name="auto1007"></a>
    <p>
        Manipulator is an abstract class for objects that know how to animate
        a Shape in response to user input, like dragging the shape to a new
        location.  There are subclasses of Manipulator for different shapes;
        TextManipulator, for example, is the corresponding subclass for
        TextShape.  By returning a TextManipulator instance, TextShape adds
        the functionality that TextView lacks but Shape requires.

    <ol>

        <a name="pluggable"></a>
        <li>
            <em>How much adapting does Adapter do?</em>
            Adapters vary in the amount of work they do to adapt Adaptee to
            the Target interface.  There is a spectrum of possible work, from
            simple interface conversion—for example, changing the names of
            operations—to supporting an entirely different set of operations.
            The amount of work Adapter does depends on how similar the Target
            interface is to Adaptee's.
        </li>

        <a name="auto1039"></a>
        <p></p>

        <a name="deleg-plug"></a>
        <li>
            <em>Pluggable adapters.</em>
            A class is more reusable when you minimize the assumptions other
            classes must make to use it.  By building interface adaptation into a
            class, you eliminate the assumption that other classes see the same
            interface.  Put another way, interface adaptation lets us incorporate
            our class into existing systems that might expect different interfaces
            to the class.
            ObjectWorks\Smalltalk&nbsp;[<a href="vfs.htm?doc=bib-0.htm&amp;fid=bb&amp;hid=parcplace_smalltalk" target="_mainDisplayFrame">Par90</a>] uses the term
            <strong>pluggable adapter</strong> to describe classes with built-in
            interface adaptation.

            <p>
                Consider a TreeDisplay widget that can display tree structures
                graphically.  If this were a special-purpose widget for use in just one
                application, then we might require the objects that it displays to
                have a specific interface; that is, all must descend from a Tree
                abstract class.  But if we wanted to make TreeDisplay more reusable
                (say we wanted to make it part of a toolkit of useful widgets), then
                that requirement would be unreasonable.  Applications will define
                their own classes for tree structures.  They shouldn't be forced to
                use our Tree abstract class.  Different tree structures will have
                different interfaces.

            <a name="auto1040"></a>
            <p>
                In a directory hierarchy, for example, children might be accessed with
                a GetSubdirectories operation, whereas in an inheritance hierarchy,
                the corresponding operation might be called GetSubclasses.  A reusable
                TreeDisplay widget must be able to display both kinds of hierarchies
                even if they use different interfaces.  In other words, the
                TreeDisplay should have interface adaptation built into it.

            <em>Using two-way adapters to provide transparency.</em>
            A potential problem with adapters is that they aren't transparent to
            all clients.  An adapted object no longer conforms to the Adaptee
            interface, so it can't be used as is wherever an Adaptee object can.
            <strong>Two-way adapters</strong> can provide such transparency.
            Specifically, they're useful when two different clients need to view
            an object differently.

                QOCA has ConstraintVariable.  To make Unidraw work with QOCA,
                ConstraintVariable must be adapted to StateVariable; to let QOCA
                propagate solutions to Unidraw, StateVariable must be adapted to
                ConstraintVariable.

                The solution involves a two-way class adapter ConstraintStateVariable,
                a subclass of both StateVariable and ConstraintVariable, that adapts
                the two interfaces to each other.  Multiple inheritance is a viable
                solution in this case because the interfaces of the adapted classes
                are substantially different. The two-way class adapter conforms to
                both of the adapted classes and can work in either system.

            <em>Implementing class adapters in C++.</em>
            In a C++ implementation of a class adapter, Adapter
            would inherit publicly from Target and privately from Adaptee.
            Thus Adapter would be a subtype of Target but not of Adaptee.

        <a name="plugap-imp"></a>
        <li>
            <em>Pluggable adapters.</em>
            Let's look at three ways to implement pluggable adapters for the
            TreeDisplay widget described earlier, which can lay out and display a
            hierarchical structure automatically.

            <a name="auto1047"></a>
            <p>
                The first step, which is common to all three of the implementations
                discussed here, is to find a "narrow" interface for Adaptee, that
                is, the smallest subset of operations that lets us do the adaptation.
                A narrow interface consisting of only a couple of operations is easier
                to adapt than an interface with dozens of operations.  For
                TreeDisplay, the adaptee is any hierarchical structure.  A minimalist
                interface might include two operations, one that defines how to
                present a node in the hierarchical structure graphically, and another
                that retrieves the node's children.
            </p>

            <a name="auto1048"></a>
            <p>The narrow interface leads to three implementation approaches:</p>

            <ol>

                <a name="absops"></a>
                <li type="a">
                    <em>Using abstract operations.</em>
                    Define corresponding abstract operations for the narrow Adaptee
                    interface in the TreeDisplay class.  Subclasses must implement the
                    abstract operations and adapt the hierarchically structured object.
                    For example, a DirectoryTreeDisplay subclass will implement these
                    operations by accessing the directory structure.

                    <a name="adapter-param1"></a>
                    <p align="CENTER"><img src="Pictures/adapt103.gif"></p>

                    <a name="auto1049"></a>
                    <p>
                        DirectoryTreeDisplay specializes the narrow interface so that it can
                        display directory structures made up of FileSystemEntity objects.
                    </p>

                </li>

                <a name="auto1050"></a>
                <p></p>

                <a name="use-dele"></a>
                <li type="a">
                    <em>Using delegate objects.</em>
                    In this approach, TreeDisplay forwards requests for accessing the hierarchical
                    structure to a <strong>delegate</strong> object.  TreeDisplay can use a
                    different adaptation strategy by substituting a different delegate.

                    <a name="direc-browse"></a>
                    <p>
                        For example, suppose there exists a DirectoryBrowser that uses a
                        TreeDisplay.  DirectoryBrowser might make a good delegate for
                        adapting TreeDisplay to the hierarchical directory structure.  In
                        dynamically typed languages like Smalltalk or Objective C, this
                        approach only requires an interface for registering the delegate with
                        the adapter.  Then TreeDisplay simply forwards the requests to the
                        delegate.  NEXTSTEP&nbsp;[<a href="vfs.htm?doc=bib-0.htm&amp;fid=bb&amp;hid=NeXT_AppKit" target="_mainDisplayFrame">Add94</a>] uses this approach heavily to
                        reduce subclassing.
                    </p>

                    <a name="treeaccdeleg"></a>
                    <p>
                        Statically typed languages like C++ require an explicit interface
                        definition for the delegate.  We can specify such an interface by
                        putting the narrow interface that TreeDisplay requires into an
                        abstract TreeAccessorDelegate class.  Then we can mix this interface
                        into the delegate of our choice—DirectoryBrowser in this
                        case—using inheritance.  We use single inheritance if the
                        DirectoryBrowser has no existing parent class, multiple inheritance if
                        it does.  Mixing classes together like this is easier than introducing
                        a new TreeDisplay subclass and implementing its operations
                        individually.

                    <em>Parameterized adapters.</em>
                    The usual way to support pluggable adapters in Smalltalk is to
                    parameterize an adapter with one or more blocks.  The block construct
                    supports adaptation without subclassing.  A block can adapt a request,
                    and the adapter can store a block for each individual request.  In our
                    example, this means TreeDisplay stores one block for converting a node
                    into a GraphicNode and another block for accessing a node's children.

                    <a name="auto1052"></a>
                    <p>For example, to create TreeDisplay on a directory hierarchy, we write</p>

                    <a name="auto1053"></a>
<pre>    directoryDisplay :=
        (TreeDisplay on: treeRoot)
             getChildrenBlock:
                 [:node | node getSubdirectories]
             createGraphicNodeBlock:
                 [:node | node createGraphicNode].
</pre>

                    <a name="auto1054"></a>
                    <p>
                        If you're building interface adaptation into a class, this approach
                        offers a convenient alternative to subclassing.

    <a name="auto1055"></a>
    <p>
        We'll give a brief sketch of the implementation of class and object
        adapters for the Motivation example beginning with the classes
        <code>Shape</code> and <code>TextView</code>.
    </p>

    <a name="auto1056"></a>
<pre>    class Shape {
    public:
        Shape();
        virtual void BoundingBox(
            Point&amp; bottomLeft, Point&amp; topRight
        ) const;
        virtual Manipulator* CreateManipulator() const;
    };
    
    class TextView {
    public:
        TextView();
        void GetOrigin(Coord&amp; x, Coord&amp; y) const;
        void GetExtent(Coord&amp; width, Coord&amp; height) const;
        virtual bool IsEmpty() const;
    };
</pre>

    <a name="textshape2"></a>
    <p>
        <code>Shape</code> assumes a bounding box defined by its opposing
        corners. In contrast, <code>TextView</code> is defined by an origin,
        height, and width. <code>Shape</code> also defines a
        <code>CreateManipulator</code> operation for creating a
        <code>Manipulator</code> object, which knows how to animate a shape
        when the user manipulates it.<a name="fn1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> <code>TextView</code> has no
        equivalent operation.  The class <code>TextShape</code> is an
        adapter between these different interfaces.
    </p>

    <a name="auto1057"></a>
    <p>
        A class adapter uses multiple inheritance to adapt interfaces. The key
        to class adapters is to use one inheritance branch to inherit the
        interface and another branch to inherit the implementation. The usual
        way to make this distinction in C++ is to inherit the interface
        publicly and inherit the implementation privately.  We'll use this
        convention to define the <code>TextShape</code> adapter.
    </p>

    <a name="auto1058"></a>
<pre>    class TextShape : public Shape, private TextView {
    public:
        TextShape();
    
        virtual void BoundingBox(
            Point&amp; bottomLeft, Point&amp; topRight
        ) const;
        virtual bool IsEmpty() const;
        virtual Manipulator* CreateManipulator() const;
    };
</pre>

    <a name="auto1059"></a>
    <p>
        The <code>BoundingBox</code> operation converts <code>TextView</code>'s
        interface to conform to <code>Shape</code>'s.
    </p>

    <a name="auto1060"></a>
<pre>    void TextShape::BoundingBox (
        Point&amp; bottomLeft, Point&amp; topRight
    ) const {
        Coord bottom, left, width, height;
    
        GetOrigin(bottom, left);
        GetExtent(width, height);
    
        bottomLeft = Point(bottom, left);
        topRight = Point(bottom + height, left + width);
    }
</pre>

    <a name="auto1061"></a>
    <p>
        The <code>IsEmpty</code> operation demonstrates the direct forwarding of
        requests common in adapter implementations:
    </p>

    <a name="auto1062"></a>
<pre>    bool TextShape::IsEmpty () const {
        return TextView::IsEmpty();
    }
</pre>

    <a name="auto1063"></a>
    <p>
        Finally, we define <code>CreateManipulator</code> (which isn't supported
        by <code>TextView</code>) from scratch.  Assume we've already implemented
        a <code>TextManipulator</code> class that supports manipulation of a
        <code>TextShape</code>.
    </p>

    <a name="auto1064"></a>
<pre>    Manipulator* TextShape::CreateManipulator () const {
        return new TextManipulator(this);
    }
</pre>

    <a name="auto1065"></a>
    <p>
        The object adapter uses object composition to combine classes with
        different interfaces.  In this approach, the adapter
        <code>TextShape</code> maintains a pointer to
        <code>TextView</code>.
    </p>

    <a name="auto1066"></a>
<pre>    class TextShape : public Shape {
    public:
        TextShape(TextView*);
    
        virtual void BoundingBox(
            Point&amp; bottomLeft, Point&amp; topRight
        ) const;
        virtual bool IsEmpty() const;
        virtual Manipulator* CreateManipulator() const;
    private:
        TextView* _text;
    };
</pre>

    <a name="textshape3"></a>
    <p>
        <code>TextShape</code> must initialize the pointer to the
        <code>TextView</code> instance, and it does so in the constructor.  It
        must also call operations on its <code>TextView</code> object whenever
        its own operations are called. In this example, assume that the client
        creates the <code>TextView</code> object and passes it to the
        <code>TextShape</code> constructor:
    </p>

    <a name="auto1067"></a>
<pre>    TextShape::TextShape (TextView* t) {
        _text = t;
    }
    
    void TextShape::BoundingBox (
        Point&amp; bottomLeft, Point&amp; topRight
    ) const {
        Coord bottom, left, width, height;
    
        _text-&gt;GetOrigin(bottom, left);
        _text-&gt;GetExtent(width, height);
    
        bottomLeft = Point(bottom, left);
        topRight = Point(bottom + height, left + width);
    }
    
    bool TextShape::IsEmpty () const {
        return _text-&gt;IsEmpty();
    }
</pre>

    <a name="et-use-adapter"></a>
    <p>
        <code>CreateManipulator</code>'s implementation doesn't change
        from the class adapter version, since it's implemented from scratch
        and doesn't reuse any existing <code>TextView</code> functionality.
    </p>

    <a name="auto1068"></a>
<pre>    Manipulator* TextShape::CreateManipulator () const {
        return new TextManipulator(this);
    }
</pre>

    <a name="auto1069"></a>
    <p>
        Compare this code to the class adapter case. The object adapter
        requires a little more effort to write, but it's more flexible.  For
        example, the object adapter version of <code>TextShape</code> will work
        equally well with subclasses of <code>TextView</code>---the client simply
        passes an instance of a <code>TextView</code> subclass to the
        <code>TextShape</code> constructor.

        The Motivation example comes from ET++Draw, a drawing application

        InterViews 2.6 defines an Interactor abstract class for user
        interface elements such as scroll bars, buttons, and menus&nbsp;[<a href="vfs.htm?doc=bib-0.htm&amp;fid=bb&amp;hid=interviews_graphic" target="_mainDisplayFrame">VL88</a>].  It also defines a
        Graphic abstract class for structured graphic objects such as lines,
        circles, polygons, and splines.  Both Interactors and Graphics have
        graphical appearances, but they have different interfaces and
        implementations (they share no common parent class) and are therefore
        incompatible—you can't embed a structured graphic object in,
        say, a dialog box directly.
    </p>

    <a name="auto1072"></a>
    <p>
        Instead, InterViews 2.6 defines an object adapter called
        GraphicBlock, a subclass of Interactor that contains a Graphic
        instance.  The GraphicBlock adapts the interface of the Graphic
        class to that of Interactor.  The GraphicBlock lets a Graphic
        instance be displayed, scrolled, and zoomed within an Interactor
        structure.

        Pluggable adapters are common in
        ObjectWorks\Smalltalk&nbsp;[<a href="vfs.htm?doc=bib-0.htm&amp;fid=bb&amp;hid=parcplace_smalltalk" target="_mainDisplayFrame">Par90</a>].  Standard Smalltalk defines
        a ValueModel class for views that display a single value.  ValueModel
        defines a <code>value</code>, <code>value:</code> interface for accessing
        the value. These are abstract methods.  Application writers access the
        value with more domain-specific names like <code>width</code> and
        <code>width:</code>, but they shouldn't have to subclass ValueModel
        to adapt such application-specific names to the ValueModel interface.
    </p>

    <a name="auto1073"></a>
    <p>
        Instead, ObjectWorks\Smalltalk includes a subclass of ValueModel
        called PluggableAdaptor.  A PluggableAdaptor object adapts other
        objects to the ValueModel interface (<code>value</code>,
        <code>value:</code>).  It can be parameterized with blocks for getting
        and setting the desired value.  PluggableAdaptor uses these blocks
        internally to implement the
        <code>value</code>, <code>value:</code> interface.  PluggableAdaptor also
        lets you pass in the selector names (e.g., <code>width</code>,
        <code>width:</code>) directly for syntactic convenience.
        It converts these selectors into the corresponding blocks
        automatically.

        Another example from ObjectWorks\Smalltalk is the TableAdaptor
        class.  A TableAdaptor can adapt a sequence of objects to a tabular
        presentation.  The table displays one object per row. The client
        parameterizes TableAdaptor with the set of messages that a table can
        use to get the column values from an object.
